As a program grows in size and complexity, it is common that different parts of the
program are stored in different source files. This allows a programmer to ensure the
source files do not become unreasonably large and would also allow multiple
programmers to more easily work on different parts of the program.
The function calls, even those written by different programmers, will work together
correctly due to the standard calling convention as outlined in Chapter 12, Functions.
This is even true when interfacing with a high-level language.
This chapter will present a simple assembly language example to demonstrate how to
create and use source code in multiple files. In addition, an example of how to interface
with a C/C++ source file is provided.
